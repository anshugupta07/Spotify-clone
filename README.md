## 🎵 Spotify Clone (HTML & CSS)

This project is a **static front-end clone of Spotify’s web interface**, created using **HTML and CSS only**. The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate modern UI design, layout structuring, and responsive styling by recreating the look and feel of Spotify’s music player.

The clone includes a visually accurate layout with a sidebar, navigation menu, playlist sections, album cards, and a footer-style music control bar. While the design closely resembles Spotify’s interface, the project does **not include music playback, JavaScript functionality, or backend integration**.
